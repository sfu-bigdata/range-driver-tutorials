    "### Reader\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently two readers supported by range_driver -- `otn` and `nsog`. Both readers require the location of key data files to work properly. These readers take in slightly different files. Each are described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### `otn`\n",
    "The `otn` reader is range_driver's primary reader. To configure the `otn` reader, you need to provide the names of three files &mdash; `detections_csv`, `otn_metadata`, and `vendor_tag_specs` &mdash; and the path to the directory containing these three files (`data_dir`). To learn more about the data and format contained within these three files, checkout the [Data Setup]() tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code snippet below you can see an example of the otn reader configuration. This is the configuration used for the [Mahone Bay]() case study. \n",

    "  otn:\n",
    "    data_dir: '{repo_path}/data/MahoneBay2016/'\n",

    "    vendor_tag_specs: tag-summary-mahone-bay-range-test.xls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `nsog`\n",
    "The `nsog` reader is a custom reader created for the [Northern Strait of Georgia]() case study. It is a slight variation on the `otn` reader where only the data directory and two file names are provided &mdash; `detections_csv` and `vender_tag_specs`. Read more about the requirements for data files provided to the `nsog` reader in the [Data Setup]() tutorial. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding your own reader\n",
    "If none of the current reange_driver readers work for your study, you can create your own custom reader. To do this, you will need to add code to two places in [`data_prep/__init__.py`](). \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will need to add a custom function to [`data_prep/__init__.py`](). This function needs to return a dataframe containing detections data and a dictionary containing metadata.

    "## Using Multiple Configuration Files\n",
    "Often, it will be helpful to re-use configurations between multiple studies. This can be done in two ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first option is to duplicate & update the configuration file from a previous study. If you want to update an option across multiple studies, you will need to update each study's configuration file accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second option (which we recommend for all but the simplest setups) is to use multiple, layered configuration files. One configuration file (e.g. `base_config.yaml`) holds configuration options shared across studies. Then, a configuration file is created to hold the study-specific configuration options for each individual study. Using layered configuration files means that you can make changes across multiple studies by updating a single file, while still allowing study-specific option specification. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you were studying the differences in detection performance between two different regions, using the same time period & environmental data sources. You'd want to standardize some of the configuration options across studies (time, data sources, etc), but you'd also need to specify different geospatial boundaries. In this case, you could use the following 3 configuration files. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You'd have a `base_config.yml` to specify the shared configuration options. \n",
